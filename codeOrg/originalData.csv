This course will teach students how to do exactly that, using BYOB and Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We'll focus on some of the ""Big Ideas"" of computing, such as abstraction, design, recursion, concurrency, simulations, and the limits of computation.

From word processing to cell phone applications, the demand for programmers grows each and every day. This course serves as a platform for students to take an introductory look at how software is developed and to become familiar with a welcoming and user friendly coding language, Visual Basic. Students will explore the beginning aspects of how to read and write code, documentation, debugging, and working in teams to accomplish a common goal. The course culminates in a final project where students will use everything they learned over the course of the semesters to create an educational piece of software from scratch(Jeopardy, flashcards, etc.). No previous programming experience or computer skills required. Introduction to Java - Spring Semester The primary language in use today is Java, developed by Sun Microsystems. Java is the backbone of everything you see today, from applications to video games. In this course, we will study the beginning elements required to successfully understand and use Java. Students will be introduced to more conceptual elements such as object oriented programming, algorithm development, and class hierarchies. AP Computer Science A What is the most efficient way to sort a list of ten thousand names in the shortest amount of time? How can we continue to maintain a programs life span without excessive use of reusing code? These are the types of complicated yet intriguing questions that will be answered in AP Computer Science. This course takes students deep into the infrastructure of the Java language, including memory efficiency, searching and sorting, data structures, and polymorphism.

The Software Entrepreneurs Club,http://www.ourfinesthour.info,High School,In School,High School CS Club,Both,"We (the Software Entrepreneurs Club Mentors) work with a group of high school students, called the Software Entrepreneurs Club (the SEC), in Hillsboro, Oregon. We have recently published our first Windows 8 app to the Windows Store. Our app is a volunteer and donation management system, for use by schools and non-profits, worldwide. Our app, called Our Finest Hour (OFH), has been made possible by a handful of Microsoft employees who have had it within their respective powers to grant the SEC access to WP7 phones, Windows 8 (Samsung) tablets and design dollars (thru MAAP), software licenses and Azure hosting (thru BizSpark). In return for these donated hardware, software, and hosting resources, we have created (and published) our first Windows 8 OFH app and we are working on our first WP7 OFH app. Both apps are early prototypes, which will continually become more product worthy as we pursue our iterative software development methodology. Our Finest Hour is a multi-year project, which will soon start to produce recurring revenue for the SEC, to be used for further product development and club-sponsored college scholarships. We first started teaching mobile software development on WP7 smartphones in the high school classroom in 2011-2012, funded by a $20K grant from Intel. We had limited success in our development efforts, but we had enough success to encourage us to start an after-school software development club, called the SEC. We started the SEC this year as the 2nd phase of our experiment to see what a group of high school students can achieve when given: - technical leadership and mentoring - an after school program that is not bell-driven (when the bell rings, students leave the classroom) and is based upon each student's desire to achieve tasks, without receiving grades to measure their successes - donations of relevant hardware, software, and services - encouragement to design and create product worthy mobile software products, without formal software development schooling - the opportunity to compete for SEC sponsored college scholarships that are based largely on each student's contributions to SEC products We have a club roster of almost 50 students, with weekly team participation ranging from 19 to 27 students. High school students have a very active schedule these days, and we feel honored to have such a high weekly participation rate from our team members. In the next couple of years, we will be growing our team to encompass students from our other 3 high schools in the Hillsboro School District. We also plan to start working with high schools from other school districts across America, to help students at other schools to learn from our failures and successes. From a mentoring perspective, our main goal for the SEC is to help to produce local software development team members who come out of high school with a set of tools upon which they can build successful software development careers. Our team members are also being encouraged to continue to contribute to the SEC after they graduate from high school. In addition to software developers, we are working to also provide students with start-up experience in the disciplines of software quality assurance, product documentation, and software marketing and advertising. We are striving to teach our team members the importance of being able to work closely with each of the disciplines required to bring quality software products to market in a timely manner. We are excited about our results to date. We delivered our Windows 8 version of OFH within a very tight schedule dictated by Microsoft and we received very positive feedback from our sponsors at Microsoft about our deliverables to date. Links to OFH in the Windows Store, Our Finest Hour's Marketing Video, and Our Finest Hour's entry in Apps for Social Good (a Microsoft contest) are provided as follows: http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/ourfinesthour/e74a5998-c429-4652-9022-5aa459e0aecb http://vimeo.com/55793109 http://www.netsquared.org/project/our-finest-hour-software-entrepreneurs-club We hope you choose to install and use Our Finest Hour.

We’ll learn just how text gets into the computer, how people have used text to tell computers what to do (i.e. what programming languages are), learn the basics of the Python programming language, and finally read and modify the code behind a few fun games written in Python. Students will learn how to understand technology by breaking it down into accessible pieces. In the process, they’ll discover the fun of using computer code as an outlet for their creativity.

There are quite a few reasons why you should: You want to write your bachelor thesis in experimental psychology? - Program your own experimental designs. You are interested in media psychology, e-learning or human-computer interaction? - Program your own interactive prototypes of websites, multimedia apps asf. You are dealing with statistical analysis on complex data sets? - Do powerful data analysis beyond what SPSS offers. You are a creative person and like arts? - Express your ideas by own pieces of interactive art. You are a technophile person and love computers? - Make the most out of it by writing your own programs. The course introduces programming to third year Psychology students. The course aims at a gentle, illustrative and non-intimidating introduction to common programming concepts. The course introduces the programming language Processing, a simplified Java, targeted at artists and designers. Besides its Java heritage, Processing has the advantage of being graphical. Students can produce nice looking drawings and animations with ease, instead of being bound to the command line. After about 6 weeks, students have acquired basic programming skills, up to developing small interactive programs and writing object-oriented code. For the remaining two weeks students choose one of three workshops, which focus on one particular purpose for programming within Psychology: (1) programming psychological experiments, (2) scientific programming and (3) programming interactive media.",Java | Processing,True,False,None,Dr. Martin Schmettow,,m.schmettow@utwente.nl,52.2412,6.85358,Universiteit Twente Drienerlolaan 5 7522 NB,Enschede,OV,,1,2013-01-31T21:54:28Z,The Netherlands,user

feynlabs,http://www.feynlabs.com,Elementary | Middle School | High School | College | Vocational,Out of School,Other,Both,"Feynlabs aims to teach the concepts of programming languages to kids (as opposed to a specific programming language). By abstracting the common elements of programming languages, our aim is to enable learners to rapidly learn any programming language. Our work has been covered in academic journals and also in leading education blogs like Edutopia. In the first six months of the launch of our page of Facebook, we have 40K fans. Currently, we are conducting trials in some schools in the UK and Europe. Feynlabs is creating a set of unique techniques to teach computer science to kids based on a) Teaching the concepts of Programming Languages to kids and b) Fostering an interest in Computer Science using the Raspberry Pi and other devices. c) Sharing content. We are a social enterprise because we share content with schools using Open source principles (i.e. for free) As pedagogy, I would consider it the re-application of Constructivist principles to the learning of Programming Languages and teaching of Computer Science in the age of the Internet. If I were to ask: What was the first programming language you learned? Depending on which era you started computing, the answer could be Basic in the 80s, Pascal in the 90s, Java/JavaScript at the turn of the century … But the point is: it’s always a specific programming language you began with. Fast forward a few years – if you did end up studying computer science, you studied the ‘Concepts of Programming Languages’ or the ‘Philosophy of Computer science’ at the Masters level for a computer science course What if you could switch the two? What if you could teach concepts of programming languages upfront – even to kids? This seemingly simple switch has many advantages. Learners have a fast on-ramp and interest. They learn at a unique pace and keep up interest. They see how programming applies to real life problems at a very early stage of their learning and they learn complex concepts of programming within a wider context Thus, our end goal is not to teach programming. Rather, it is to enable the participants to rapidly master any programming language and in doing so, explore computer science. Feynlabs is addressing a unique (not yet addressed) problem – which I can encapsulate as ‘How do we take learners from 0 to 60 fast?’ i.e. accelerate the computer science learning at an early stage so that learners don’t get bogged down and can quickly see the ‘vista’ i.e. the big picture vision’. From a learning standpoint this would useful because once the participant can see the big picture and they can add their own unique contribution/imagination to learning This leads to a different conversation in teaching. Instead of discussing endless variants of IF-THEN-ELSE statements and FOR loops, we have the freedom to explore the beauty and interconnectedness of Computer Science at an early stage. We can talk of hardware and software and algorithms holistically. We can introduce the principles of Systems thinking. We can prepare kids for the next way of computing by looking at a variety of computing devices (not just PCs). Thus, Feynlabs is preparing learners for a career in Computer Science. We focus on Raspberry Pi and Python as teaching platforms (but also work with others)",Arduino | C++ | HTML | Java | Javascript | Python | Raspberry pi (platform) | Scratch,True,False,None,Ajit Jaokar,,info@feynlabs.com,51.5143,-0.144766,"futuretext landmark house, 17 hanover square",London,None,W1S 1HU,1,2013-02-18T03:56:18Z,United Kingdom,user

Since launching in February of 2011, CodeNow has completed four cohorts of phase one of its program in Washington D.C. Providing more than 3,000 hours of free training to students in the programming language Ruby. In March 2013 , CodeNow will launch its first training in New York City. Over a six week period students will receive 40+ hours of in person training held on the weekends and 10 hours of homework. During which they have an opportunity to earn a netbook by arriving on time, finishing homework and completing projects.

You'll learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the ground up become awesome at using Git for version control get totally comfortable working with command line tools learn to write jQuery plugins from scratch get hands-on experience with the newest HTML5 tech build non-trivial, production quality JS apps with Backbone.js work with languages that compile down to JS, like CoffeeScript and ClojureScript learn your way around Rails, with a focus on what's important to know for frontend work in Rails apps. build apps that run lean and fast on both desktop and mobile browsers and much more ;) What kind of students are we looking for? Before we get into specifics, we need to let you know that this class is going to be challenging. Material will get really hard, really quickly. All of the work is very do-able, but if you think you're going to develop professional level skills in a cushy 40 hour week, this isn't the place for you. (We estimate you'll put in about 60.) We're family people, so our goal is for you to work as hard as possible in class so you can find balance in a great job when you're done. We're really excited about the different types of people who are going to apply, and we don't have stereotypes of what a developer is like. Here are a few things we'll look for: Hard worker - Like we said above, this won't be a walk in the park. Prepare for a rigorous course. Self motivated - If you need to be managed, this isn't the place for you. Works well with others - you'll be assigned to groups for projects, and each person's role will be crucial. Interested in learning, even if you know some code Even if you know basics, you might have to unlearn some things. We'll start from the ground up as a team, and there won't be room for egos. Graceful problem solver - We'll work on some hard stuff, and patience is a must. Ready to have fun - We work hard, play hard, and laugh every single day. We do the best work we possibly can, but we make sure not to take ourselves too seriously. What will the schedule look like? Monday through Thursday: Class starts at 9am 9am - 12pm: lecture time 12pm - 1pm: lunch 1pm - ?pm: lab work Some days might include afternoon lectures Lectures: Lessons will be fast-paced, interactive, and funny. Hopefully. The goal is for you to absorb a whole lot of information, then apply it on a real project during lab. Lunch: Working hard requires resting hard, so we try to enjoy lunch as much as possible - whether we're heating leftovers or heading to Barley's for a slice and a pint. From our space you can walk or bike to the river, parks, amazing coffee, tasty food, or craft beer, and we like to take advantage of that access. Lab work: In lab you'll be working on real websites and apps that real people will use - not scripted assignements. We're partnering with the city, non-profits, and other organizations who have problems that we can help solve. (Life in Greenville is a great example.) You'll have access to the space 24 hours a day, just in case you need to burn some midnight oil. Fridays: Catch up day Open lab time with the instructor (9am-5pm) Time with The Iron Yard Mentors when they're in town Fridays will be a chance to breathe, take a break from intense lectures, and catch up if you need to. If Iron Yard Mentors are in town, we'll be able attend their talks and spend time with them when possible. (They're awesome people with a lot to offer. See for yourself.) We'll also strongly encourage you to contribute to open source projects, build your own stuff, and learn new languages.

The focus of the course is to introduce students to the world of programing -- with emphasis on how programing is used in business and not necessarily on game programing, but elements of that genre are explored. This is a year-long course, broken into three sections. The first section covers HTML/JavaScript through the use of student-created projects using Microsoft's Visual Web Developer Express platform. The students learn how to use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to build web pages, and to incorporate JavaScript into those pages. The course covers the commonly used page elements such as text boxes, radio buttons, check boxes, buttons, and discusses the JavaScript programming language and how it is used within web pages. To illustrate the concepts, students build web pages for fictional companies (e.g. restaurant surveys). The second section covers Visual Basic using Microsoft's Visual Basic .Net Express platform. The students learn how to use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop fully functional windows-based programs. The course covers the commonly used windows-based elements such as text boxes, buttons, drop down lists, menus, dialog boxes, as well as the Basic programming language. To illustrate the concepts, the students create their own Notepad (a simple text editor) and a functional, lightweight web browser. The third section covers Visual C# using Microsoft's Visual C# .Net Express platform. The students learn how to use this Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop fully functional windows-based programs. The course covers the commonly used windows-based elements such as text boxes, buttons, drop down lists, menus, dialog boxes, as well as the C# programming language.

Developed by the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), the New York City Economic Development Corporation, and supported by Microsoft and other major partners, GenTech is built around the following four components that seek to educate and inspire students to pursue careers in entrepreneurship and technology: 1) Summer Programming: In a two-week tech-entrepreneurship bootcamp, students learn about technology fundamentals, including computer programming and 3D printing, as well as how to write a business plan and lean startup methodologies. Students develop basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and form teams to develop a mobile app and business plan aimed at improving education or the quality of city life for NYC students. Using the foundational skills from the bootcamp, students focus on building out their mobile app and business plans for another six weeks with a mix of evening mentoring sessions and group and independent work. Throughout the summer, students are exposed to the NYC tech startup ecosystem through guest speakers and field trips. (July-August) 2) Mentorship & Enterprise Discovery: : Students receive mentorship from local business/technology undergraduate and graduate students during the bootcamp phase. After the bootcamp, each student team is paired with a small team of Tech Mentors from industry-leading tech and business organizations. Tech Mentors provide support, insight, and guidance to students during evening mentoring sessions. Mentoring sessions are held at various tech-related companies throughout NYC. 3) Demo Night & Awards Ceremony: In September, students demo and pitch their finished apps and business plans to a panel of prominent judges from the technology and venture capitalist community. Members of the winning team receive cash prizes and all students are honored at an awards ceremony. Hackathons: During the fall and early winter, GenTech students will participate in mobile app hackathons alongside professional developers and designers so that students can further develop skills in coding and design, gain more experience of working with tech professionals, and continue to build a network within the tech and startup sectors. 4) Hackathons: During the fall and early winter, GenTech students participate in mobile app hackathons alongside professional developers and designers so that students further develop skills in coding and design, gain more experience of working with tech professionals, and continue to build a network within the tech and startup sectors.",Css | HTML | Javascript,False,False,None,,,nycgenerationtech@nfte.com,40.705,-74.0053,"120 Wall Street, 18 Floor",New York,NY,10005,1,2013-04-11T17:31:12Z,United States,user

HEAT Institute by Stanford alumni,http://www.heatinstitute.org,High School | College,Out of School,Summer camp,Both,"HEAT is an academic and professional development institute based in Silicon Valley dedicated towards the advancement of the humanities, entrepreneurship and technology, with curriculum developed in collaboration with members of QSci Lab at the Center for the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University. Our programs operate in Palo Alto just two blocks from the home of the late Steve Jobs. We are building a platform for students, educators, and professionals across disparate fields to enhance interdisciplinary knowledge discovery and innovation with a curricular focus on Big Data and Data Science applications. HEAT started the world's first dedicated Data Science course for high school and undergraduate students in 2011-2012, offering students an insider's introduction to curriculum that is now making the rounds in the Harvard Business Review, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, the New York Times, and in new institutions that have emerged in 2013. Just as Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded the very ""birthplace of Silicon Valley"" in their Palo Alto garage, the HEAT team believes academic and professional educators perform their best in an environment in which they can freely design and teach new curricula. We work closely with individual professors, teachers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and professionals from Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, UC Berkeley, USF, Google, Facebook, Apple, Intel, and a number of other Silicon Valley institutions currently facing a critical shortage of Big Data and Data Science talent. We are committed to providing future generations innovative curricula and pedagogy not found at any single institution. Data Science is an emerging field using Big Data that relies heavily on the expertise of other fields to help us make better decisions. Research by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) (Big Data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity) forecasts a 50 to 60 percent gap between the supply and demand of people with deep analytical talent in big data. Big Data is predicted to create over 4.4 million jobs globally by 2015, and the HEAT Institute aims to prepare students of all backgrounds for ""the sexiest job of the 21st century,"" according to the Harvard Business Review, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and the New York Times. Previously obscured as a subset of computer science, Data Science is actually an accessible way for students and professionals outside of computer science to harness the latest tools in software engineering. The techniques, theories, logic, ideas and vocabulary of any field (including medicine, law, public policy, finance, and education) can be stored and used as data, which serves as the lifeblood of software engineering. The demand for data scientists is as, if not more, pressing as the need for computer scientists. HEAT SV is launching a new data science core with the help of Google's Visualization API and datasets to prepare future graduates in any field for the new economy. So where do we find tomorrow's Data Science superheroes? According to the Wall Street Journal: ""Not from universities, it seems. Nigel Shadbolt, who doubles up as the professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton as well as co-director of the U.K.'s Open Data Institute, said the courses don't yet exist. 'Bits of it do exist in various departments around the country, and also in businesses, but as an integrated discipline it is only just starting to emerge.'"" The HEAT Institute aims to nurture creativity and critical thinking in students around the world by offering a core humanities curriculum, business and technology practica, and a platform for building interdisciplinary applications of knowledge. In the data science core, students will: -Learn about big data and relevant technologies -Learn about databases and structured query language (SQL) -Practice the extract, transform, load process used by every technology company using programming languages such as Python, PHP, and JavaScript and tools such as Pentaho Data Integration. -Learn how to tell stories with data and use data as the basis of your own startup company -Attend a field trip to a Silicon Valley company that uses large datasets on a day-to-day basis Participants will also do one of the following: -Build complex extract, transform, and load processes on large datasets such as US patents and US trademarks datasets provided by Google -Build their own portfolio of dynamic data visualizations using Google API and Tableau -Build their own functional ""Facebook"" social networking website -Build a search engine using US Patent And Trademark Data provided by Google",Google visualization api | HTML | Javascript | Mapreduce | Mysql | PHP | Pentaho data integration | Python | Tableau,True,False,None,HEAT Institute by Stanford alumni,650-503-4325,heatinstitute@alumni.stanford.edu,37.4304,-122.179,210 Panama St.,Stanford,CA,94305,1,2013-07-01T03:37:27Z,United States,user

Casey-Westfield High School,http://www.cw.k12.il.us/education/school/school.php?sectiondetailid=103,High School,Out of School,Afterschool program,Both,"The Mid-American Programming Group was founded by Julie Littlejohn, the computer/business teacher at Casey-Westfield High School in Casey, IL. One of the classes Mrs. Littlejohn taught was Introduction to Programming, where students learned fundamental, foundational, and practical programming skills. Some of the students in this class wanted to learn more about programming, but no Advanced Programming class was offered by the school. Mrs. Littlejohn approached Willy Farrell, a friend who had been programming professionally for more than 30 years (including many years at IBM), and asked him if he would facilitate an afterhours program to provide Advanced Programming training to her interested students. Being a card-carrying member of the Mrs. Littlejohn Fan Club himself, he agreed to do it, free of charge, and on his own time. Currently, Willy Farrell heads the programming group, and because she is retired and pursuing other interests, Mrs. Littlejohn is not as involved in the group as she once was. All inquiries about the group should be made to Willy, though all still warmly regard Julie Littlejohn as our Founder. The group started with one student, and called itself the Learning Java Advanced Programming Group. Soon after starting, another student joined the group. Later, a member was added who was still taking the Introduction to Programming class while participating, so Advanced was dropped from the title. Willy quickly realized there was a problem with group members getting enough computer time to complete their assigned exercises. To solve this, he bought every member of the group a small but adequate laptop. Willy understands that group members are the best and brightest from Casey-Westfield High School and are involved in a lot of activities, so an excuse by a member that he or she didn't get an assignment done because of extracurricular activities is readily accepted. But he will not accept these excuses: 1) “I didn't get the assignment done because I didn't understand it”. Not acceptable – every group member has the phone number and email address of Willy. Members can call or write Willy night and day if they have a problem or need some help; 2) “I didn’t get enough computer time to finish the assignment”. Not acceptable – Willy got you a laptop to prevent that possibility. Initially, the group was meeting every Sunday at 1PM at a local fast-food restaurant where they could usually find a booth. But the booths were rather small and it was difficult to juggle textbooks and laptops. And it was a bit loud. The group needed a bigger, quieter place. Plus, the group was made aware of a YouTube video about coding/programming (willyfarrell.com/coders) that inspired them to try and grow. Enter Pastor Michael Kasting of Trinity Lutheran Church. When asked if the programmers could use the conference room in his church, he readily consented. His remarks were: “When I was approached about the possibility of using the facilities of Trinity Lutheran Church for a programming class for high school students, I was glad to make our facility available. The kids need a quiet space to gather. God has blessed us with quiet space in abundance. It makes sense to share it! With our schools facing a financial crunch, we’re glad we can help in this very practical way. It will be exciting to see what comes from this venture”. With a place that gave the group room to expand, the group decided to make that growth happen. So as not to exclude anyone, the group changed its name to the Mid-American Programming Group. New members to the group still begin by learning Java, a very popular programming language. But after that they learn C#, a popular Microsoft programming language. The goal is to get members certifications in these languages. A certification isn't a college degree (though members are consistently encouraged to go to college), but a certification can make the resume of a college graduate more appealing to employers. After Java and C#, there are a multitude of Web design languages and techniques that can be explored and mastered, and the group is setting out to do just that. The programming group also doesn't want to limit itself to only those in Casey, which is part of the reason for the name change. When we reach a certain point in our learning, we would like to do free software projects for local organizations, with our preference being charitable and not-for-profit institutions. Please watch the video at willyfarrell.com/coders. It’s only 9 minutes long and is a real eyeopener about the importance of what the Mid-American Programming Group is doing. What the group is doing is good for our community; programmers often get jobs where they can work from home, so our best and brightest can stay right here in Casey. And what the group is doing is good for our young people – did you catch the part in the video where 1.4 million programming jobs will be created but only 400,000 U.S. students will get the required training for those jobs? Let’s give our young people the opportunity to get one of those jobs that will be created and drive the economy of the future. It costs about $500 to add a member to the group – laptop, mouse, textbook, thumb drive. Up to now, Willy has borne those expenses, and happily. But Willy can only afford to add one member every month or two, say 8 or 9 per year. That pace is too slow for the group to have the kind of community impact for which it is striving. The teachers at the high school have identified upwards of a dozen students that would benefit by being in the group. They are also reaching out to high schools in nearby towns to identify students in those schools that would like to join the group. If they all came at once, Willy could not afford to equip each one of them. With $10,000, 20 students could join the group. The group needs help raising those kinds of funds. Won’t you help the Mid-American Programming Group add members and give them the tools and equipment they need for success?

Costa Rica´s National Program of Educational Informatics MEP-FOD,http://www.fod.ac.cr,Preschool | Elementary | Middle School | High School | Vocational,In School,Other,Both,"The Omar Dengo Foundation of Costa Rica is a private, non-profit organization that since 1987 has developed and executed national projects in the fields of educational innovation and digital technologies in public schools with a distinctive use of coding (programming) as a central tool to stimulate creativity, thinking skills and problem-solving abilities in teachers, children and youth. The National Program of Educational Informatics of the Ministry of Public Education and the Omar Dengo Foundation (PRONIE MEP-FOD), that currently serves 512.232 students in 1,668 public elementary and high schools thorough the country, is strongly linked to the epistemological theories of Piaget and Vigotsky concerning social and cognitive development in individuals, and has based its pedagogical foundation on the constructionist theory of Dr. Seymour Papert. The Foundation, based on a constructivist approach to teaching and learning, introduced the use of computers in public schools in Costa Rica in 1988 to provide opportunities for children and youth to improve their capacities and computer programming has always been at the core of the program´s activities. The Foundation´s programs have introduced programming throughout Costa Rica´s public school system as a mean for children and youth to make representation and share personal interpretations of their knowledge and they have started programming computers from an early age. Teachers and researchers have been trained to facilitate computational thinking tasks and approaches proposed by researchers from MIT such as tinkering, debugging, remixing, abstraction, and use of modules. Elementary school children start by using tile programming interfaces (drag and drop) as a way to simplify syntax structure and help them understand algorithmic thinking. High-school age youth expand their programming experience with the use of open code writing (scripting) and object-oriented programming. Programming is then used as a powerful resource for developing abilities such as learning to reason logically and creatively, interactive resolution of problems, learning by design of robots, and teamwork.

Creative Computing for Kids is designed to make introduction to programming both easier and fun. By using a simplified visual programming system called Scratch, your child can explore and learn at their own pace and tackle problems through trial and error. It is a 4 session pilot workshops designed to give children aged between 8-13 an introduction to programming, inspired by the Code.org video featuring Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. We believe that this early exposure gives kids an opportunity to discover themselves, nurture their natural curiosity while instilling the basic groundwork of computational thinking.

Creative Coding for Kids- After School & Day Camps,http://www.creativecoding4kids.com,Elementary,Out of School,Afterschool program,Both,"We teach kids ages 8-12 the joy of coding, by helping them write their own customized computer game! In addition to our summer camps, we now offer after-school programs at several Seattle Schools, plus all-day coding camps on certain ""no school"" days. Our unique games-centered approach is winning rave reviews from both kids and parents. We use Scratch, the MIT-developed tool created just for this purpose. Our philosophy: Today's computers are more like a box of crayons than a calculator. Major math skills are no longer required. The most important traits for coding today are CREATIVITY and PERSISTENCE. The key is to make it fun, start young, and encourage your child's work on their own pet projects, so they learn because they want to make their own thing awesome. It works brilliantly. Read reviews on our site. To see if we're teaching at your school, (or request that we come to you) please go to our website. The address given is our ""No School"" all-day camp location. Girls and boys are taught in a supportive, mutually respectful, fun environment. Classes offered for all skill levels and may be repeated to progress further.

(The George Lucas Educational Foundation) Place-Based Learning immerses students in local heritage, culture, landscapes, opportunities, and experiences as a foundation for the study of language arts, mathematics, social studies, science, and other subjects. Place-based education encourages teachers and students to use the schoolyard, community, public lands, and other special places as resources, turning communities into classrooms.
